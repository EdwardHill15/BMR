In a three-hour training/ workshop you will experience directly the relaxing and beneficial effect of concentration and mindful movement as a specific form of meditation on your body and mind.<br><br>

By focusing your attention on your breathing, muscles and body posture during exercise you will experience the thrill of flow in consciousness, which relaxes your mind and body during exercise.<br><br>

Body Movement Reprocessing Therapy can be seen as partially a specific form of meditation from the Buddhist philosophy of life.<br><br>

By consciously focusing your attention during physical exercise on inner body sensations your consciousness experience a wholesome state of health and wellbeing.
